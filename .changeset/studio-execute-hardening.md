**@askdb/studio** (security): Playground execute is now opt-in, runs one read-only statement at a time, and has a timeout and a row cap.

- **Off by default.** `POST /api/execute` returns `403` with setup instructions until `studio.execute.enabled: true` is set. The Playground hides the Execute button and shows why. `/api/execute/status` now reports `enabled`, `disabledReason`, `timeoutMs`, and `maxRows`.
- **No silent credential reuse.** Execute no longer falls back to the introspection connection. Set `studio.execute.databaseUrl` / `file`, ideally for a read-only role, or opt in with `studio.execute.useIntrospectionConnection: true`. This is a breaking change for projects that relied on the fallback.
- **Validated before execution.** Every query must pass `@askdb/core`'s `validateSelectSql` for the execute engine's dialect. Otherwise the request fails with `400` and never reaches the driver. SQL that reads `sensitive` columns returns `warnings`.
- **One read-only statement.** Postgres forces the extended query protocol, so `SELECT 1; COMMIT; DROP …` can no longer escape `BEGIN READ ONLY`, and turns on `default_transaction_read_only`. MySQL and MariaDB use a prepared statement in `START TRANSACTION READ ONLY`. SQL Server runs inside `SET XACT_ABORT ON; BEGIN TRANSACTION … ROLLBACK`. SQL Server has no read-only mode, so use a read-only login.
- **Timeouts and row caps.** Queries time out after 30 s by default (`studio.execute.timeoutMs`; not enforced for SQLite). Studio fetches at most `studio.execute.maxRows + 1` rows (default 500) and reports `truncated` and `rowLimit`, instead of loading every row and slicing.
- **Bounded requests.** JSON bodies over 1 MiB return `413`. Playground history keeps only known fields with length limits. Studio adds `playground-history.json` to the schema directory's `.gitignore`, creating the file with `.env` rules if it doesn't exist.
- **Driver install.** Inherited keys such as `constructor` are rejected with `400`, and installs now work on Windows. The setup wizard and install endpoint share one package-manager spawn helper.
- The setup wizard now defaults Studio execute to off, and choosing it writes `enabled: true`.

**@askdb/config**: New `studio.execute` fields, each with a canonical flat key: `enabled` (`ASKDB_STUDIO_EXECUTE_ENABLED`, default `false`), `useIntrospectionConnection` (`ASKDB_STUDIO_EXECUTE_USE_INTROSPECTION_CONNECTION`, default `false`), `timeoutMs` (`ASKDB_STUDIO_EXECUTE_TIMEOUT_MS`, default `30000`), and `maxRows` (`ASKDB_STUDIO_EXECUTE_MAX_ROWS`, default `500`). The runtime `studio.execute.databaseUrl` / `file` no longer fall back to the introspection connection unless `useIntrospectionConnection` is `true`. Also exports `DEFAULT_STUDIO_EXECUTE_TIMEOUT_MS` and `DEFAULT_STUDIO_EXECUTE_MAX_ROWS`.

**askdb**: `askdb init` writes `enabled: true` in the `studio.execute` block when you choose Studio execute. The interactive wizard now defaults that choice to off, matching `--studio-execute`'s documented default.
