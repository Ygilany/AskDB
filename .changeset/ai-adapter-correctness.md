Fix AI adapter correctness bugs that the AI SDK silently ignored.

**@askdb/ai-azure**: Embedding `dimensions`/`user` are now sent. They were wrapped under `providerOptions.azure`, but `@ai-sdk/azure` builds embeddings with `OpenAIEmbeddingModel`, which reads only `providerOptions.openai`, so they were dropped. `reasoningEffort` now also sets `forceReasoning: true`. The AI SDK decides whether a model can reason from the model id it was given, which on Azure is the deployment name. Without this flag, a deployment such as `askdb-reporting` backed by `modelFamily: "gpt-5"` silently lost its reasoning effort. The missing-resource error now names the config keys (`ai.providerConfig.azure.resourceName` / `baseUrl`) and gives the `AZURE_RESOURCE_NAME` env alternative.

**@askdb/ai-google**: Embeddings use the non-deprecated `google.embedding()` and now honor `dimensions`, mapped to Gemini's `outputDimensionality`.

**@askdb/ai-openai / @askdb/ai-azure**: Reasoning-model detection no longer treats `gpt-5-chat*` (non-reasoning chat models) as reasoning models. It now recognizes gpt-5 point releases and later majors (`gpt-5.1`, `gpt-6`, …). gpt-6 and later accept `low` through `max` but not `minimal`, so a `minimal` effort is sent as `low` for them. This covers Azure deployments with a custom name and `modelFamily: "gpt-6"`, where the SDK can't see the family and would otherwise send `minimal`.

**@askdb/ai-anthropic**: Reasoning-model detection now follows `@ai-sdk/anthropic`'s capability table. Claude Sonnet 4.6, Opus 4.6+, and the 5.x models (Opus 5, Sonnet 5, Fable 5, …) get adaptive thinking (`thinking: { type: "adaptive" }` plus `effort`) instead of the manual `budgetTokens` form, which newer models reject. Claude Haiku 4.5 now gets extended thinking.

**@askdb/ai**: `aiKeyMissingMessage` now lists Anthropic. `aiProviderMissingMessage` maps aliases to the package that owns them (for example, `foundry` points to `@askdb/ai-azure`). It no longer suggests a nonexistent `@askdb/ai-<name>` package for custom providers. `withEmbeddingProviderOptions` takes an optional fourth argument that maps the portable `dimensions`/`user` options to a provider's own setting names; `@askdb/ai-google` now uses it instead of its own wrapper.

**@askdb/config**: `AzureConfig` / `FoundryConfig` gain `resourceName`, which is flattened to the key the Azure adapter reads. Before this, a config-only Azure setup couldn't supply a resource name and failed at startup. `ASKDB_AI_PROVIDERS` now includes `"anthropic"`. New `@askdb/config/scaffold` entry point for tools that write a new `askdb.config.ts`: `renderAskDbAiConfigScaffold` renders its `ai` block and lists the env vars it reads, and `askdb init` and Studio's setup wizard both use it. The main entry is unchanged apart from `resourceName` and `ASKDB_AI_PROVIDERS`.

**askdb / @askdb/studio**: `askdb init --ai-provider azure|foundry` and Studio's setup wizard (Azure OpenAI or Foundry) scaffold `resourceName: env("AZURE_RESOURCE_NAME")` and list `AZURE_RESOURCE_NAME` in `.env.example`, so the generated config works out of the box. `askdb init`'s `.env.example` now puts a one-line comment above each AI variable, and lists the SQLite file variable (`SQLITE_FILE` or the `--sqlite-file` env name) when the config reads one. It now also lists `DATABASE_URL` for `--database prisma --studio-execute` and `ASKDB_PGVECTOR_URL` for `--rag-store pgvector` without `--pgvector-env`, both of which the config read but `.env.example` left out, and lists each variable once. `--sqlite-file` now treats only an env-name-shaped value (`UPPER_SNAKE_CASE`) as a variable; a relative path such as `data.db` or `../db/app.db` is written as a literal path instead of `env("data.db")`.
