**@askdb/core**: `loadSchema()` and `loadSchemaFromJson()` now apply `sensitive: true` from table markdown front-matter (`tables/*.md`), at both the table and the `columns[]` level, on top of `schema.json`. Before, front-matter `sensitive` was parsed but ignored. Studio's Sensitivity tab writes front-matter, so a column marked Sensitive there was still treated as non-sensitive by the NL→SQL prompt (tagging and `omitSensitiveIdentifiersFromNlToSqlPrompt`), by `@askdb/rag` chunk exclusion, and by `validateSensitiveReferences`.

The rule is escalate-only. Front-matter can make a table or column sensitive but can never make one less sensitive. A front-matter `sensitive: false` on a table or column that is sensitive anyway (from `schema.json`, or for a column from a sensitive table) is ignored and reported in `NormalizedSchemaV2.warnings` as the new `{ kind: "sensitivity_downgrade_ignored", tableFile, id }` warning. Directory and bundle loads behave the same way.

This is a behavior change: schemas whose front-matter already sets `sensitive: true` will now have more sensitive tables and columns. Those tables and columns lose their describable fields in the normalized schema, are tagged or omitted in prompts, are excluded from RAG chunks by default, and are flagged by the sensitive-SQL guardrail. Code that switches exhaustively over `SchemaV2Warning["kind"]` needs to handle the new kind.

**@askdb/studio**: the Sensitivity tab's "Effective" column now matches the loader. It accounts for table-level sensitivity, and "Not sensitive" is disabled where it could not take effect.
