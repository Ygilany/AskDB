## 1.0.0-beta.4

### Minor Changes

- 0c44b76: Add provider-portable reasoning/latency effort controls for AskDB model calls.

  Set `reasoningEffort: "minimal" | "low" | "medium" | "high"` via `@askdb/ai`'s
  `resolveProviderOptions(config, { reasoningEffort })` and each `@askdb/ai-*`
  adapter maps it to the provider's native knob — OpenAI/Azure
  `providerOptions.openai.reasoningEffort`, Google Gemini 3.x
  `thinkingConfig.thinkingLevel`, Gemini 2.5 `thinkingConfig.thinkingBudget`,
  Anthropic extended `thinking`. Adapters skip models that don't support
  reasoning tuning, so unsupported providerOptions are never sent.

  `@askdb/core`'s `ask()`, `generateSelectSql()`, and `suggestEnrichment()` gain
  an opaque `providerOptions` passthrough forwarded verbatim to `generateText`
  — core stays BYO-model and does not interpret it. Unset, behavior is
  unchanged.

  `askdb.config.*` gains an `ai.reasoning` block (`effort`, `nlToSql`,
  `enrichment`) for per-call-site defaults, flattened to
  `ASKDB_AI_REASONING_EFFORT[_NL_TO_SQL|_ENRICHMENT]` env vars.

  `@askdb/client`'s `createAskDb`/`ask()` now resolve `ai.reasoning` and apply
  it automatically — no manual wiring required for the common client/CLI/HTTP
  API path. `CreateAskDbOptions.reasoningEffort` sets a client-level default;
  `AskOverrides.reasoningEffort` overrides it per call. Studio's sample-question
  and enrichment-suggestion endpoints resolve and forward reasoning effort the
  same way.

  Azure/Foundry deployments are identified by an arbitrary deployment name that
  may not match the underlying model id, so reasoning-model detection can't
  always rely on `model` alone. Set `providerConfig.azure.modelFamily` (or
  `ASKDB_AI_AZURE_MODEL_FAMILY`) to the real model id (e.g. `"gpt-5"`) to
  declare it explicitly when the deployment name doesn't already look like one.

- 0c62b25: Upgrade the Vercel AI SDK integration to AI SDK 7.

  This moves `ai` to `^7.0.51` and the first-party provider packages to their AI SDK 7-compatible majors:

  - `@ai-sdk/openai` `^4.0.29`
  - `@ai-sdk/anthropic` `^4.0.29`
  - `@ai-sdk/google` `^4.0.33`
  - `@ai-sdk/azure` `^4.0.30`

  AI SDK 7 requires Node.js 22 or newer, so AskDB packages that expose or carry the AI SDK runtime now advertise `node >=22`. Core model calls now use the AI SDK 7 `instructions` option, and the Google adapter uses the renamed `createGoogle` provider factory.

## 1.0.0-beta.3

### Minor Changes

- 7311ac5: **@askdb/client**: `createAskDb()` accepts a new `providers` option — pass the adapter(s) for your configured provider and the client builds the AI registry internally:

  ```ts
  import { createAskDb } from "@askdb/client";
  import { openaiProvider } from "@askdb/ai-openai";

  const askdb = createAskDb({
    config: getAskDbRuntimeConfig(),
    providers: [openaiProvider], // no more createAiRegistry boilerplate
  });
  ```

  You no longer import anything from `@askdb/ai` on the config-driven path — it is now a regular dependency of `@askdb/client` (previously a peer), so install commands drop it too. The existing `registry` option remains supported as the advanced alternative (e.g. sharing one registry across several clients); passing both, or neither, throws with a clear message. Non-breaking for existing `registry` callers.

  **@askdb/studio**: the Playground "Get the code" panel emits the new `providers` style in its config-driven snippet.

### Patch Changes

- 162c33b: Docs only: package READMEs now lead with the `createAskDb({ providers: [...] })` path — no direct `@askdb/ai` import — with the standalone `createAiRegistry` usage kept as the documented advanced alternative.
- Updated dependencies [162c33b]
- Updated dependencies [7311ac5]
  - @askdb/ai@0.1.0-beta.4
  - @askdb/core@1.0.0-beta.36

## 1.0.0-beta.2

### Patch Changes

- Updated dependencies [dc380bc]
  - @askdb/config@1.0.0-beta.9

## 0.1.0-beta.1

### Minor Changes

- 354c833: Add `@askdb/client`: a config-aware `createAskDb()` facade that resolves schema, model, and dialect from the runtime config so callers only pass a question. `schema`, `model`, and `dialect` remain optional per-call overrides. `ask()` in `@askdb/core` is unchanged and remains the pure, BYO-model primitive.
- 354c833: `@askdb/client` now throws typed errors and supports `unknownDialect: "throw" | "fallback-postgres"`. The HTTP API uses those error types to return 400 `schema_parse_error` for missing schema files and to preserve the postgres fallback for unrecognized schema providers.
