# @askdb/ai

## 0.1.0-beta.6

### Minor Changes

- 1131e77: CommonJS applications can now `require()` AskDB packages, where package resolution previously failed with `ERR_PACKAGE_PATH_NOT_EXPORTED`. The minimum supported Node.js version is now 22.12, which provides unflagged `require(esm)` support. No runtime behavior or exported symbols changed.

## 0.1.0-beta.5

### Minor Changes

- 0c44b76: Add provider-portable reasoning/latency effort controls for AskDB model calls.

  Set `reasoningEffort: "minimal" | "low" | "medium" | "high"` via `@askdb/ai`'s
  `resolveProviderOptions(config, { reasoningEffort })` and each `@askdb/ai-*`
  adapter maps it to the provider's native knob — OpenAI/Azure
  `providerOptions.openai.reasoningEffort`, Google Gemini 3.x
  `thinkingConfig.thinkingLevel`, Gemini 2.5 `thinkingConfig.thinkingBudget`,
  Anthropic extended `thinking`. Adapters skip models that don't support
  reasoning tuning, so unsupported providerOptions are never sent.

  `@askdb/core`'s `ask()`, `generateSelectSql()`, and `suggestEnrichment()` gain
  an opaque `providerOptions` passthrough forwarded verbatim to `generateText`
  — core stays BYO-model and does not interpret it. Unset, behavior is
  unchanged.

  `askdb.config.*` gains an `ai.reasoning` block (`effort`, `nlToSql`,
  `enrichment`) for per-call-site defaults, flattened to
  `ASKDB_AI_REASONING_EFFORT[_NL_TO_SQL|_ENRICHMENT]` env vars.

  `@askdb/client`'s `createAskDb`/`ask()` now resolve `ai.reasoning` and apply
  it automatically — no manual wiring required for the common client/CLI/HTTP
  API path. `CreateAskDbOptions.reasoningEffort` sets a client-level default;
  `AskOverrides.reasoningEffort` overrides it per call. Studio's sample-question
  and enrichment-suggestion endpoints resolve and forward reasoning effort the
  same way.

  Azure/Foundry deployments are identified by an arbitrary deployment name that
  may not match the underlying model id, so reasoning-model detection can't
  always rely on `model` alone. Set `providerConfig.azure.modelFamily` (or
  `ASKDB_AI_AZURE_MODEL_FAMILY`) to the real model id (e.g. `"gpt-5"`) to
  declare it explicitly when the deployment name doesn't already look like one.

- 0c62b25: Upgrade the Vercel AI SDK integration to AI SDK 7.

  This moves `ai` to `^7.0.51` and the first-party provider packages to their AI SDK 7-compatible majors:

  - `@ai-sdk/openai` `^4.0.29`
  - `@ai-sdk/anthropic` `^4.0.29`
  - `@ai-sdk/google` `^4.0.33`
  - `@ai-sdk/azure` `^4.0.30`

  AI SDK 7 requires Node.js 22 or newer, so AskDB packages that expose or carry the AI SDK runtime now advertise `node >=22`. Core model calls now use the AI SDK 7 `instructions` option, and the Google adapter uses the renamed `createGoogle` provider factory.

## 0.1.0-beta.4

### Patch Changes

- 162c33b: Docs only: package READMEs now lead with the `createAskDb({ providers: [...] })` path — no direct `@askdb/ai` import — with the standalone `createAiRegistry` usage kept as the documented advanced alternative.

## 0.1.0-beta.3

### Minor Changes

- d4a0a1d: Add Anthropic Claude as a supported AI provider, open the config provider union for custom adapters, and make the key-missing message registry-driven.

  **New package: `@askdb/ai-anthropic`** — Set `ASKDB_AI_PROVIDER=anthropic` and `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` (or the universal `ASKDB_AI_API_KEY`) to use Anthropic Claude models. The default model is `claude-sonnet-4-6`; override with `ASKDB_AI_MODEL` or `ANTHROPIC_MODEL`. The `anthropic` provider is also configurable via `askdb.config.*` using the new `providerConfig.anthropic` branch (`apiKey`, `model`, `baseUrl`). Anthropic has no embeddings API; `createEmbeddingModel` throws a clear error directing you to configure a separate embedding provider.

  **Registry-driven key-missing message (`@askdb/ai`)** — `AiProviderAdapter` gains an optional `configHint` field. `AiRegistry` gains `keyMissingMessage(context)` that assembles hints from all registered adapters (deduplicated across aliases, stable registration order). The static `aiKeyMissingMessage` export is deprecated in favor of `ai.keyMissingMessage(context)`. All four surfaces (CLI, HTTP API, Studio, TUI) now use the registry method so Anthropic (and any future adapter) is automatically mentioned.

  **Custom provider config branch (`@askdb/config`)** — `AskDbAiConfig` now accepts any provider string, not just the four known literals. Known literals still get dedicated branches with required `providerConfig`; any other string falls through to the new `CustomAiConfig` branch, which flattens to the universal `ASKDB_AI_*` env keys. Custom providers only work end to end when the host registry contains an adapter registered under that provider name — the first-party apps register only first-party adapters.

- 4dd7a59: Make AI provider adapters self-describing. Standalone `resolveAiConfig` and
  `resolveEmbeddingConfig` moved onto `createAiRegistry()` registry instances, and
  adapters now own their native env vars, aliases, defaults, and provider-specific
  connection options.

  `AiConfig.resourceName` and `AiConfig.apiVersion` were replaced by
  `AiConfig.providerOptions`; Azure reads `resourceName` and `apiVersion` from
  that bag. The `ai` package is now a peer dependency of `@askdb/ai` and all
  first-party AI adapter packages.

  Google behavior is now provider-correct: it no longer falls back to
  `OPENAI_API_KEY_SECONDARY`, its default language model is `gemini-2.0-flash`,
  and embeddings require an explicit Google embedding model instead of falling
  back to OpenAI's `text-embedding-3-small`.

- 96e6963: Add `withEmbeddingProviderOptions` helper to `@askdb/ai` and use it in the OpenAI and Azure adapters, eliminating the near-identical per-adapter middleware blocks. Deprecates `createOpenAiEmbedder` in `@askdb/rag` — use `createAiSdkEmbedder` with an `@askdb/ai-openai` model or the `@askdb/ai` registry instead; the helper will be removed in 1.0.

## 0.1.0-beta.2

### Patch Changes

- baf5ad8: Restore AI SDK 6 embedding compatibility and preserve RAG embedding options.
- baf5ad8: Refresh dependency ranges across the workspace.

## 0.1.0-beta.1

### Minor Changes

- bc8642f: Move AskDB AI provider construction helpers from `@askdb/core` into the new `@askdb/ai` registry and provider adapter packages.

  `@askdb/core` now exposes `AskDbLanguageModel` as its public model type and no longer installs concrete AI SDK provider packages. Consumers that used `createAskDbLanguageModelFromEnv`, embedding model factories, or AI config resolution from core should create an `@askdb/ai` registry with provider adapters such as `@askdb/ai-openai`.
