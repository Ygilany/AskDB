# @askdb/ai

## 0.1.0-beta.8

### Minor Changes

- 11e2457: Restructure the `ai` config into provider connections plus a section per model, and stop a RAG key from reaching the wrong provider (#345, #435).
  
  **@askdb/config**: `ai.providerConfig.<provider>` now holds provider connections only (keys, endpoints, Azure resources, API versions), as one object or a list of named connections. The model choice moves to two sections, each with an optional `provider` and `connection`: `ai.language` (`model`, `modelFamily`, `reasoning`) and `ai.embedding` (`model`, `dimensions`), which `rag.embedder: "ai"` uses. The embedding model can come from a different provider than the language model, so an Anthropic setup can embed with OpenAI, and one provider can have two connections, such as two Azure resources. `ai.embedding.model` is required with `rag.embedder: "ai"`: AskDB no longer picks an embedding model for you. AskDB assumes no vector width: `ai.embedding.dimensions` is optional for every model and only requests a size from the provider. Unset, AskDB uses the width the model returns, learned when an index is built, so the pgvector store no longer needs a width in the config. A custom provider's connection is keyed by its provider id. The runtime config gains `ai.language`, `ai.embedding` (each with an `env` map built from that section's connection only) and `deprecations`. `ai.aiEnv` and the flat map's language keys are unchanged. Its `ASKDB_RAG_EMBEDDER*` keys follow the new shape: `ASKDB_RAG_EMBEDDER` is `"ai"` for the old `"openai"` and `"ai-sdk"`, `ASKDB_RAG_EMBEDDER_DIMENSIONS` holds only a configured width (or, for the mock embedder with the pgvector store, its 64), and `ASKDB_RAG_EMBEDDER_API_KEY` and `_BASE_URL` are no longer written, since the embedding key lives on its connection.
  
  Existing configs keep loading, apart from the cases listed below. Each old key is translated at load and reported once per process as a Node `DeprecationWarning` (code `ASKDB_CONFIG_DEPRECATED`) naming the old and new location, never the value: `providerConfig.<provider>.model` and Azure's `modelFamily` move to `ai.language`, `ai.reasoning` to `ai.language.reasoning`, `providerConfig.custom` to `providerConfig.<provider id>`, `rag.embedder: "openai" | "ai-sdk"` and `rag.embedderConfig.openai` to `rag.embedder: "ai"` plus `ai.embedding`, and `rag.storeConfig.pgvector.dimensions` (with an AI embedder) to `ai.embedding.dimensions`. With `rag.embedder: "mock"`, `rag.storeConfig.pgvector.dimensions` gets the same warning, saying it's ignored: the mock embedder's vectors are always 64 wide, as Studio already assumed. The old keys and the deprecated type aliases (`OpenaiConfig`, `OpenaiAiConfig`, …, `OpenaiRagEmbedderConfig`, `defaultRagEmbeddingDimensions`) are removed at 1.0.
  
  The key leak is fixed. A `rag.embedderConfig.openai.apiKey` or `.baseUrl` now moves to a connection of the embedding model's provider, and only when that provider is `openai`, `azure`, `foundry` or `gateway`; before, Studio sent the OpenAI key to the language model's provider (for example Google). The `askdb-rag` CLI's embedder settings no longer fall back to `ASKDB_AI_API_KEY` or `ASKDB_AI_BASE_URL`, so a custom provider's key or the gateway's URL no longer reaches OpenAI.
  
  These old-shape configs loaded before and now fail to load, each with an error that says what to change:
  
  - a `rag.embedderConfig.openai.apiKey` or `.baseUrl` whose embedding model would come from a provider other than `openai`, `azure`, `foundry` or `gateway` (the leak above);
  - `rag.embedder: "ai-sdk"` with no embedding model on a provider other than `openai`, `azure` or `foundry`, which asked that provider for `text-embedding-3-small`;
  - `rag.embedder: "ai-sdk"` with Anthropic as the language model's provider, which never embedded, since Anthropic has no embeddings API;
  - `rag.embedderConfig.openai.dimension` and `rag.storeConfig.pgvector.dimensions` set to different widths, where the pgvector value used to win silently;
  - an old key set next to its replacement: `ai.reasoning` with `ai.language.reasoning`, `ai.providerConfig.custom` with `ai.providerConfig.<provider id>`, or `rag.embedderConfig` with `ai.embedding`.
  
  **@askdb/rag**: New `detectEmbeddingDimensions(embedder)` learns an embedder's vector width by embedding one short text, so hosts don't have to hard-code a width. `createPgvectorStore`'s `dimensions` is now optional: it's needed only to create the table (`setupSql()`, or `ensureSchema()` when the table doesn't exist yet). The store gains `tableDimensions()`, and `ensureSchema()` now refuses an existing table whose width differs from `dimensions` with a `PgvectorDimensionMismatchError` (exported, with `table`, `tableDimensions` and `dimensions`), instead of keeping it and letting inserts fail partway through indexing. `buildSchemaIndex` records the width of the vectors it wrote in the lock file's `dimensions`.
  
  **@askdb/ai**: `ProviderEnvSpec.defaultEmbeddingModel` is deprecated. When an env map names no embedding model, `openai`, `azure` and `gateway` still fall back to their default, now with a one-time `DeprecationWarning` (code `ASKDB_AI_DEFAULT_EMBEDDING_MODEL`); the fallback is removed at 1.0. Configs never reach it, since `ai.embedding.env` always names the model. The "no embedding model" error points at `ai.embedding.model`, and the gateway and Anthropic messages name `ai.embedding` instead of the old `rag` keys.
  
  **@askdb/studio**: RAG embeds through the `ai.embedding` section's connection only. Settings shows the active embedder, the workspace reports the configured language model instead of a hard-coded `gpt-4o-mini`, and a RAG failure names the section, provider, connection and model. Studio no longer assumes a vector width. With pgvector, the first index build asks the embedding model for its width (one short embedding call) and creates the table at that width; an existing table of another width is refused with a 409 before any chunk is embedded, and the message names the table and how to resolve it: drop it and build again, point `rag.storeConfig.pgvector.table` at a new table, or set `ai.embedding.dimensions` to the table's width. The status page no longer creates the table, and shows the width recorded at the last build. Index ids carry a width only when `ai.embedding.dimensions` sets one, so an existing index built without one shows as stale once: rebuild it, or, for an old-shape config, set the width the deprecation warning names to keep it. Setup writes the new shape.
  
  **askdb**: `askdb init` writes the model to `ai.language.model` and no longer writes `rag.embedderConfig: {}`.
- c6e289a: The OpenAI, Azure OpenAI / Foundry, Google, and Anthropic providers are now built into `@askdb/ai`. The `@askdb/ai-*` packages are deprecated (ADR 0006 amendment, Option E).
  
  **@askdb/ai**: ships the four providers (moved unchanged from `@askdb/ai-*`) plus a new zero-dependency `gateway` provider for the Vercel AI Gateway (`AI_GATEWAY_API_KEY`, model ids like `openai/gpt-4o-mini`). Each provider loads its AI SDK package lazily, the first time it builds a model. `@ai-sdk/openai`, `@ai-sdk/azure`, `@ai-sdk/google`, and `@ai-sdk/anthropic` are now **optional peer dependencies**: install the one for the provider you configure. If it's missing, model creation fails with `Provider 'google' requires the optional peer dependency @ai-sdk/google. Install it: npm i @ai-sdk/google`. The peer ranges are `^4.0.0` (the contract tests pass against 4.0.0), so a host on an older 4.x SDK isn't forced to upgrade. The lazy imports are written so esbuild builds without the SDKs a host didn't install. webpack 5 doesn't: see the webpack note under the deprecated packages below.
  
  - `createAiRegistry()` with no arguments registers every built-in provider. It also accepts built-in names and aliases (`createAiRegistry(["openai"])`), mixed freely with `AiProviderAdapter` objects. Custom adapters work unchanged.
  - New exports: `BUILTIN_AI_PROVIDERS` (one table of names, aliases, env vars, default models, and SDK packages), `getBuiltinAiProviderSetup`, `listBuiltinAiProviderSetups`, the adapters `openaiProvider` / `azureProvider` / `googleProvider` / `anthropicProvider` / `gatewayProvider`, and the `AiProviderSelector` type.
  - `aiProviderMissingMessage` now says to pass the built-in name to `createAiRegistry()` and to install `@ai-sdk/<provider>`, instead of naming an `@askdb/ai-*` package. `aiKeyMissingMessage` also lists the gateway.
  - The `gateway` provider maps reasoning effort through its upstream (`openai/`, `google/`, `anthropic/` model ids), sends embedding `dimensions` for `openai/` and `google/` models and refuses them for other upstreams, and rejects model ids without an `<upstream>/` prefix.
  - The `openai` provider now also sends `forceReasoning: true` with a reasoning effort, so an `@ai-sdk/openai` release that predates a model family (gpt-6 before 4.0.60) still sends it.
  - The built-in adapters' `createLanguageModel` / `createEmbeddingModel` are now `async`. The `AiProviderAdapter` contract already allowed promises, and `AiRegistry` methods were already async.
  
  **@askdb/ai-openai, @askdb/ai-azure, @askdb/ai-google, @askdb/ai-anthropic (deprecated)**: each now only re-exports its adapter from `@askdb/ai`, which it depends on directly (it was a peer). It keeps its `@ai-sdk/*` dependency, so existing installs and imports keep working, except in a webpack bundle. These packages will be removed before 1.0 (#347).
  
  **webpack users, including shim users who change nothing:** importing `@askdb/client`, `@askdb/ai`, or a shim now reaches every built-in provider's `import("@ai-sdk/<x>")`, and webpack 5 fails with `Module not found: Error: Can't resolve '@ai-sdk/google'` (and the other SDKs you don't have). Before this release, `@askdb/client` + `@askdb/ai-openai` bundled without the other SDKs. Install all four `@ai-sdk/*` packages, or mark the ones you don't use as `externals` (with ESM output, use `externalsType: "module"` and the bare package names):
  
  ```js
  // webpack.config.js: list the @ai-sdk/* packages you don't install.
  module.exports = {
    // ...
    externals: {
      "@ai-sdk/anthropic": "commonjs @ai-sdk/anthropic",
      "@ai-sdk/azure": "commonjs @ai-sdk/azure",
      "@ai-sdk/google": "commonjs @ai-sdk/google",
    },
  };
  ```
  
  A provider whose SDK isn't installed then fails at runtime with the install message. esbuild needs no change.
  
  To migrate:
  
  ```diff
  - npm i @askdb/ai-openai
  + npm i @askdb/ai @ai-sdk/openai
  
  - import { openaiProvider } from "@askdb/ai-openai";
  - const askdb = createAskDb({ config, providers: [openaiProvider] });
  + const askdb = createAskDb({ config }); // or providers: ["openai"]
  
  - const ai = createAiRegistry([openaiProvider]);
  + const ai = createAiRegistry(["openai"]);
  ```
  
  **@askdb/client**: `createAskDb({ config })` no longer throws when neither `providers` nor `registry` is passed. It registers every built-in `@askdb/ai` provider, and `ai.provider` in the config picks one. `providers` also accepts built-in names. The four `@ai-sdk/*` packages are declared as optional peers (`^4.0.0`) so strict installs such as Yarn Plug'n'Play pass the host's SDK through to `@askdb/ai`.
  
  **@askdb/config**: new `ai.provider: "gateway"` branch (`providerConfig.gateway.{apiKey, baseUrl, model}`, flattened to `AI_GATEWAY_API_KEY` / `ASKDB_AI_BASE_URL` / `ASKDB_AI_MODEL`). `ASKDB_AI_PROVIDERS` includes `"gateway"`. `DEFAULT_ANTHROPIC_CHAT_MODEL`, `DEFAULT_GOOGLE_CHAT_MODEL`, and `DEFAULT_GATEWAY_CHAT_MODEL` are now exported. A test in `@askdb/client` (which depends on both) fails if this list, these defaults, or the env var names `flatten` writes drift from the built-in provider table. `askdb init` and Studio's setup wizard take each provider's default API key and model env var names from `@askdb/ai`'s provider table instead of keeping their own copies.
  
  **askdb, @askdb/http-api, @askdb/studio**: register providers with `createAiRegistry()` and depend on `@askdb/ai` plus all four `@ai-sdk/*` packages instead of `@askdb/ai-*`. They still work from env/config alone. `askdb init` and Studio setup now take their provider choices and scaffolded env var names from `@askdb/ai`'s table, and both offer the Vercel AI Gateway. Google now scaffolds `GOOGLE_AI_MODEL`, the variable the provider actually reads, instead of `GOOGLE_GENERATIVE_AI_MODEL`. Studio's "Get the code" snippet uses `@askdb/client` + `@ai-sdk/<provider>`. `askdb help init` lists every `--ai-provider` value, including `gateway`.
  
  **@askdb/rag**: the deprecation note on `createOpenAiEmbedder` now points at `createAiRegistry(["openai"])` instead of the `@askdb/ai-openai` adapter.
- 9021e54: Raise the supported Node floor from `>=22.12` to `>=22.14` (`engines.node` in every published package). `better-sqlite3` 13, which the `@askdb/sqlite` and `@askdb/studio` peer ranges allow, segfaults on Node 22.12.0 through 22.13.1 and works from 22.14.0 (bisected on linux-x64; upstream WiseLibs/better-sqlite3#1514). Hosts on Node 22.12 or 22.13 should upgrade to Node 22.14 or newer.

### Patch Changes

- e57c734: Fix AI adapter correctness bugs that the AI SDK silently ignored.
  
  **@askdb/ai-azure**: Embedding `dimensions`/`user` are now sent. They were wrapped under `providerOptions.azure`, but `@ai-sdk/azure` builds embeddings with `OpenAIEmbeddingModel`, which reads only `providerOptions.openai`, so they were dropped. `reasoningEffort` now also sets `forceReasoning: true`. The AI SDK decides whether a model can reason from the model id it was given, which on Azure is the deployment name. Without this flag, a deployment such as `askdb-reporting` backed by `modelFamily: "gpt-5"` silently lost its reasoning effort. The missing-resource error now names the config keys (`ai.providerConfig.azure.resourceName` / `baseUrl`) and gives the `AZURE_RESOURCE_NAME` env alternative.
  
  **@askdb/ai-google**: Embeddings use the non-deprecated `google.embedding()` and now honor `dimensions`, mapped to Gemini's `outputDimensionality`.
  
  **@askdb/ai-openai / @askdb/ai-azure**: Reasoning-model detection no longer treats `gpt-5-chat*` (non-reasoning chat models) as reasoning models. It now recognizes gpt-5 point releases and later majors (`gpt-5.1`, `gpt-6`, …). gpt-6 and later accept `low` through `max` but not `minimal`, so a `minimal` effort is sent as `low` for them. This covers Azure deployments with a custom name and `modelFamily: "gpt-6"`, where the SDK can't see the family and would otherwise send `minimal`.
  
  **@askdb/ai-anthropic**: Reasoning-model detection now follows `@ai-sdk/anthropic`'s capability table. Claude Sonnet 4.6, Opus 4.6+, and the 5.x models (Opus 5, Sonnet 5, Fable 5, …) get adaptive thinking (`thinking: { type: "adaptive" }` plus `effort`) instead of the manual `budgetTokens` form, which newer models reject. Claude Haiku 4.5 now gets extended thinking.
  
  **@askdb/ai**: `aiKeyMissingMessage` now lists Anthropic. `aiProviderMissingMessage` maps aliases to the package that owns them (for example, `foundry` points to `@askdb/ai-azure`). It no longer suggests a nonexistent `@askdb/ai-<name>` package for custom providers. `withEmbeddingProviderOptions` takes an optional fourth argument that maps the portable `dimensions`/`user` options to a provider's own setting names; `@askdb/ai-google` now uses it instead of its own wrapper.
  
  **@askdb/config**: `AzureConfig` / `FoundryConfig` gain `resourceName`, which is flattened to the key the Azure adapter reads. Before this, a config-only Azure setup couldn't supply a resource name and failed at startup. `ASKDB_AI_PROVIDERS` now includes `"anthropic"`. New `@askdb/config/scaffold` entry point for tools that write a new `askdb.config.ts`: `renderAskDbAiConfigScaffold` renders its `ai` block and lists the env vars it reads, and `askdb init` and Studio's setup wizard both use it. The main entry is unchanged apart from `resourceName` and `ASKDB_AI_PROVIDERS`.
  
  **askdb / @askdb/studio**: `askdb init --ai-provider azure|foundry` and Studio's setup wizard (Azure OpenAI or Foundry) scaffold `resourceName: env("AZURE_RESOURCE_NAME")` and list `AZURE_RESOURCE_NAME` in `.env.example`, so the generated config works out of the box. `askdb init`'s `.env.example` now puts a one-line comment above each AI variable, and lists the SQLite file variable (`SQLITE_FILE` or the `--sqlite-file` env name) when the config reads one. It now also lists `DATABASE_URL` for `--database prisma --studio-execute` and `ASKDB_PGVECTOR_URL` for `--rag-store pgvector` without `--pgvector-env`, both of which the config read but `.env.example` left out, and lists each variable once. `--sqlite-file` now treats only an env-name-shaped value (`UPPER_SNAKE_CASE`) as a variable; a relative path such as `data.db` or `../db/app.db` is written as a literal path instead of `env("data.db")`.
- e7ea657: Accept `ai` from 7.0.51 again, and `@ai-sdk/openai` from 4.0.29 for `@askdb/rag`'s embedding peer. The last dependency bump raised every `ai` range to `^7.0.113` and `@askdb/rag`'s `@ai-sdk/openai` peer to `^4.0.74`, though AskDB needs nothing newer. A host that pins an older `ai` couldn't install the release with npm (`ERESOLVE`), and pnpm gave AskDB a second AI SDK instead of the host's. These ranges now rise only when AskDB needs a newer version or a security fix, and the changelog says which (#403).

## 0.1.0-beta.7

### Patch Changes

- ab2150b: Bump dependencies: AI SDK (`ai` 7.0.113, `@ai-sdk/*` 4.0.x), zod 4.6, mysql2 3.24, pg 8.23, @prisma/internals 7.10, @inquirer/prompts 8.7, React 19.3 and Vite 8.3 for Studio, and vitest 5 across the workspace.
- 2787b21: Release packaging fixes:

  - Ship `LICENSE` and `NOTICE` in `@askdb/ai`, `@askdb/ai-anthropic`, `@askdb/ai-azure`, `@askdb/ai-google`, `@askdb/ai-openai`, `@askdb/mysql`, `@askdb/sqlite`, and `@askdb/sqlserver` (they were listed in `files` but missing from the tarballs).
  - `@askdb/studio`: React, Radix UI, lucide-react, react-router, clsx, tailwind-merge, and class-variance-authority are bundled into the prebuilt browser client, so they are now dev dependencies and are no longer installed with the package.
  - Add `"sideEffects": false` to library packages (`@askdb/rag` lists its bin entry as side-effectful), and point `homepage` at the relevant askdb.tools page.
  - Package READMEs no longer link to repo-relative paths that npmjs.com cannot resolve.

## 0.1.0-beta.6

### Minor Changes

- 1131e77: CommonJS applications can now `require()` AskDB packages, where package resolution previously failed with `ERR_PACKAGE_PATH_NOT_EXPORTED`. The minimum supported Node.js version is now 22.12, which provides unflagged `require(esm)` support. No runtime behavior or exported symbols changed.

## 0.1.0-beta.5

### Minor Changes

- 0c44b76: Add provider-portable reasoning/latency effort controls for AskDB model calls.

  Set `reasoningEffort: "minimal" | "low" | "medium" | "high"` via `@askdb/ai`'s
  `resolveProviderOptions(config, { reasoningEffort })` and each `@askdb/ai-*`
  adapter maps it to the provider's native knob — OpenAI/Azure
  `providerOptions.openai.reasoningEffort`, Google Gemini 3.x
  `thinkingConfig.thinkingLevel`, Gemini 2.5 `thinkingConfig.thinkingBudget`,
  Anthropic extended `thinking`. Adapters skip models that don't support
  reasoning tuning, so unsupported providerOptions are never sent.

  `@askdb/core`'s `ask()`, `generateSelectSql()`, and `suggestEnrichment()` gain
  an opaque `providerOptions` passthrough forwarded verbatim to `generateText`
  — core stays BYO-model and does not interpret it. Unset, behavior is
  unchanged.

  `askdb.config.*` gains an `ai.reasoning` block (`effort`, `nlToSql`,
  `enrichment`) for per-call-site defaults, flattened to
  `ASKDB_AI_REASONING_EFFORT[_NL_TO_SQL|_ENRICHMENT]` env vars.

  `@askdb/client`'s `createAskDb`/`ask()` now resolve `ai.reasoning` and apply
  it automatically — no manual wiring required for the common client/CLI/HTTP
  API path. `CreateAskDbOptions.reasoningEffort` sets a client-level default;
  `AskOverrides.reasoningEffort` overrides it per call. Studio's sample-question
  and enrichment-suggestion endpoints resolve and forward reasoning effort the
  same way.

  Azure/Foundry deployments are identified by an arbitrary deployment name that
  may not match the underlying model id, so reasoning-model detection can't
  always rely on `model` alone. Set `providerConfig.azure.modelFamily` (or
  `ASKDB_AI_AZURE_MODEL_FAMILY`) to the real model id (e.g. `"gpt-5"`) to
  declare it explicitly when the deployment name doesn't already look like one.

- 0c62b25: Upgrade the Vercel AI SDK integration to AI SDK 7.

  This moves `ai` to `^7.0.51` and the first-party provider packages to their AI SDK 7-compatible majors:

  - `@ai-sdk/openai` `^4.0.29`
  - `@ai-sdk/anthropic` `^4.0.29`
  - `@ai-sdk/google` `^4.0.33`
  - `@ai-sdk/azure` `^4.0.30`

  AI SDK 7 requires Node.js 22 or newer, so AskDB packages that expose or carry the AI SDK runtime now advertise `node >=22`. Core model calls now use the AI SDK 7 `instructions` option, and the Google adapter uses the renamed `createGoogle` provider factory.

## 0.1.0-beta.4

### Patch Changes

- 162c33b: Docs only: package READMEs now lead with the `createAskDb({ providers: [...] })` path — no direct `@askdb/ai` import — with the standalone `createAiRegistry` usage kept as the documented advanced alternative.

## 0.1.0-beta.3

### Minor Changes

- d4a0a1d: Add Anthropic Claude as a supported AI provider, open the config provider union for custom adapters, and make the key-missing message registry-driven.

  **New package: `@askdb/ai-anthropic`** — Set `ASKDB_AI_PROVIDER=anthropic` and `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` (or the universal `ASKDB_AI_API_KEY`) to use Anthropic Claude models. The default model is `claude-sonnet-4-6`; override with `ASKDB_AI_MODEL` or `ANTHROPIC_MODEL`. The `anthropic` provider is also configurable via `askdb.config.*` using the new `providerConfig.anthropic` branch (`apiKey`, `model`, `baseUrl`). Anthropic has no embeddings API; `createEmbeddingModel` throws a clear error directing you to configure a separate embedding provider.

  **Registry-driven key-missing message (`@askdb/ai`)** — `AiProviderAdapter` gains an optional `configHint` field. `AiRegistry` gains `keyMissingMessage(context)` that assembles hints from all registered adapters (deduplicated across aliases, stable registration order). The static `aiKeyMissingMessage` export is deprecated in favor of `ai.keyMissingMessage(context)`. All four surfaces (CLI, HTTP API, Studio, TUI) now use the registry method so Anthropic (and any future adapter) is automatically mentioned.

  **Custom provider config branch (`@askdb/config`)** — `AskDbAiConfig` now accepts any provider string, not just the four known literals. Known literals still get dedicated branches with required `providerConfig`; any other string falls through to the new `CustomAiConfig` branch, which flattens to the universal `ASKDB_AI_*` env keys. Custom providers only work end to end when the host registry contains an adapter registered under that provider name — the first-party apps register only first-party adapters.

- 4dd7a59: Make AI provider adapters self-describing. Standalone `resolveAiConfig` and
  `resolveEmbeddingConfig` moved onto `createAiRegistry()` registry instances, and
  adapters now own their native env vars, aliases, defaults, and provider-specific
  connection options.

  `AiConfig.resourceName` and `AiConfig.apiVersion` were replaced by
  `AiConfig.providerOptions`; Azure reads `resourceName` and `apiVersion` from
  that bag. The `ai` package is now a peer dependency of `@askdb/ai` and all
  first-party AI adapter packages.

  Google behavior is now provider-correct: it no longer falls back to
  `OPENAI_API_KEY_SECONDARY`, its default language model is `gemini-2.0-flash`,
  and embeddings require an explicit Google embedding model instead of falling
  back to OpenAI's `text-embedding-3-small`.

- 96e6963: Add `withEmbeddingProviderOptions` helper to `@askdb/ai` and use it in the OpenAI and Azure adapters, eliminating the near-identical per-adapter middleware blocks. Deprecates `createOpenAiEmbedder` in `@askdb/rag` — use `createAiSdkEmbedder` with an `@askdb/ai-openai` model or the `@askdb/ai` registry instead; the helper will be removed in 1.0.

## 0.1.0-beta.2

### Patch Changes

- baf5ad8: Restore AI SDK 6 embedding compatibility and preserve RAG embedding options.
- baf5ad8: Refresh dependency ranges across the workspace.

## 0.1.0-beta.1

### Minor Changes

- bc8642f: Move AskDB AI provider construction helpers from `@askdb/core` into the new `@askdb/ai` registry and provider adapter packages.

  `@askdb/core` now exposes `AskDbLanguageModel` as its public model type and no longer installs concrete AI SDK provider packages. Consumers that used `createAskDbLanguageModelFromEnv`, embedding model factories, or AI config resolution from core should create an `@askdb/ai` registry with provider adapters such as `@askdb/ai-openai`.
